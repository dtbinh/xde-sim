abstract = { We consider the control of interacting subsystems whose dynamics and constraints are decoupled, but whose state vectors are coupled non-separably in a single cost function of a finite horizon optimal control problem. For a given cost structure, we generate distributed optimal control problems for each subsystem and establish that a distributed receding horizon control implementation is stabilizing. The implementation requires synchronous updates and the exchange of the most recent optimal control trajectory between coupled subsystems prior to each update. Key requirements for stability are that each subsystem not deviates too far from the previous open-loop state trajectory, and that the receding horizon updates happen sufficiently fast. The venue of multi-vehicle formation stabilization is used to demonstrate the distributed implementation and simulations are provided.},

@article{Borrelli2006,
abstract = {We consider the problem of optimal cooperative three-dimensional conflict resolution involving multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) using numerical trajectory optimization methods. The conflict problem is posed as an optimal control problem of finding trajectories that minimize a certain objective function while maintaining the safe separation between each UAV pair. We assume the origin and destination of the UAV are known and consider UAV models with simplified linear kinematics. The main objective of this report is to present two different approaches to the solution of the problem. In the first approach, the optimal control is converted to a finite dimensional nonlinear program (NLP) by using collocation on finite elements and by reformulating the disjunctions involved in modeling the protected zones by using continuous variables. In the second approach the optimal control is converted to a finite dimensional mixed integer linear program (MILP) using Euler discretization and reformulating the disjunctions involved with the protected zones by using binary variables and Big-M techniques. Based on results of extensive random simulations, we compare time complexity and optimality of the solutions obtained with the MILP approach and the NLP approach. NLPs are essential to enforce flyability constraints on more detailed UAV models. Moreover, any nonlinear extensions to the problem cannot be dealt with by MILP solvers. The main objective of this paper is to open the route to the use of MILP solutions (based on simple linear UAV models) in order to initialize NLP solvers which allow the use of dynamic UAV models at any desired level of detail},

@phdthesis{Milam2003,
abstract = {With the advent of powerful computing and efficient computational algorithms, real-time solutions to constrained optimal control problems are nearing a reality. In this thesis, we develop a computationally efficient Nonlinear Trajectory Generation (NTG) algorithm and describe its software implementation to solve, in real-time, nonlinear optimal trajectory generation problems for constrained systems. NTG is a nonlinear trajectory generation software package that combines nonlinear control theory, B-spline basis functions, and nonlinear programming. We compare NTG with other numerical optimal control problem solution techniques, such as direct collocation, shooting, adjoints, and differential inclusions. We demonstrate the performance of NTG on the Caltech Ducted Fan testbed. Aggressive, constrained optimal control problems are solved in real-time for hover-to-hover, forward flight, and terrain avoidance test cases. Real-time trajectory generation results are shown for both the two-degree of freedom and receding horizon control designs. Further experimental demonstration is provided with the station-keeping, reconfiguration, and deconfiguration of micro-satellite formation with complex nonlinear constraints. Successful application of NTG in these cases demonstrates reliable real-time trajectory generation, even for highly nonlinear and non-convex systems. The results are among the first to apply receding horizon control techniques for agile flight in an experimental setting, using representative dynamics and computation.},

@article{Ong1997,
abstract = {An algorithm is presented for computing the Euclidean distance
between a pair of objects represented by convex polytopes in three
dimensional space. It is a fast version of the well known algorithm by
Gilbert, Johnson and Keerthi (1988) in which the polytopes are
characterized by their vertices. The improvement in speed comes from the
inclusion of additional structural information on the objects; for each
vertex there is a list of adjacent vertices. No other information or
preprocessing of data is needed. Following Cameron, the adjacency
structures are used to greatly reduce the number of inner product
evaluations needed to compute the polytope support functions used in the
original Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm. When the algorithm is
applied to a pair of objects that move incrementally along smooth paths,
it shares the advantage of the incremental distance algorithm introduced
by Lin and Canny (1991). Algorithmic details and performance issues are
developed fully. Computational experiments provide quantitative data on
the effects of object complexity and the size of incremental object
motions},

abstract = {There are many situations for which a feasible nonholonomic motion plan must be generated immediately based on real-time perceptual information. Parametric trajectory representations limit computation because they reduce the search space for solutions (at the cost of potentially introducing suboptimality). The use of any parametric trajectory model converts the optimal control formulation into an equivalent nonlinear programming problem. In this paper, curvature polynomials of arbitrary order are used as the assumed form of solution. Polynomials sacrifice little in terms of spanning the set of feasible controls while permitting an expression of the general solution to the system dynamics in terms of decoupled quadratures. These quadratures are then readily linearized to express the necessary conditions for optimality. Resulting trajectories are convenient to manipulate and execute in vehicle controllers and they can be computed with a straightforward numerical procedure in real time.},

The position and shape of obstacles are computed by a vision algorithm using a single camera.

We formulate an optimal control problem for a set of dynamically decoupled systems where the cost function and constraints couple the dynamical behavior of the systems. The coupling is described through a graph where each system is a node, and cost and constraints of the optimization problem associated with each node are only function of its state and the states of its neighbors. The complexity of the problem is addressed by breaking a centralized RHC controller into distinct RHC controllers of smaller sizes. Each RHC controller is associated with a different node and computes the local control inputs based only on the states of the node and of its neighbors. We analyze the properties of the proposed scheme and introduce sufficient stability conditions based on prediction errors. Finally, we focus on linear systems and show how to recast the stability conditions into a set of matrix semi-definiteness tests.},
