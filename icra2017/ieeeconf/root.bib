abstract = "This paper proposes the real-time implementation of an algorithm for collision-free motion planning based on a receding horizon approach, for the navigation of a team of mobile robots in the presence of obstacles of different shapes. The method is simulated with three robots. The impact of the parameters is studied with regard to computation time, obstacle avoidance and travel time.",

abstract = {This paper presents a decentralized motion planner for a team of nonholonomic mobile robots subject to constraints imposed by sensors and the communication network. The motion planning scheme consists of decentralized receding horizon planners that reside on each vehicle to achieve coordination among flocking agents. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that each vehicle only requires local knowledge of its neighboring vehicles. The main requirement for designing an optimal conflict-free trajectory in a decentralized way is that each robot does not deviate too far from its presumed trajectory designed without taking the coupling constraints into account. A comparative study between the proposed algorithm and other existing algorithms is provided in order to show the advantages, especially in terms of computing time. Finally, experiments are performed on a team of three mobile robots to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
